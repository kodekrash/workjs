# WorkJS

WorkJS is a suite of jQuery user interface plugins. Unlike most plugins, which rely solely on existing DOM node, WorkJS is designed to be more programmatically controlled, making it easier to build controls on the fly, ie: from external data sources, or based on application logic, without the needs to have all the possible views pre-defined in templates or pages.

This code was written in 2010-2011, and most of the functionality can now be found in Bootstrap, Semantic UI, etc. It has been released here for demonstration and reference purposes, and it not intended for production use, as it is not maintained.
